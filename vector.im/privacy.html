        <li class="privacy__p">Information that you provide when you apply for a role. This includes information provided through an online job site, via email, in person at interviews and/or by any other method.</li>
        <li class="privacy__p">In particular, we  process personal details such as name, email address, address, date of birth qualifications, experience, information relating to your employment history, skills and experience that you provide to us.</li>

      </ul>
      <h3 class="privacy__subline">Information we collect from other sources<br></h3>
      <p class="privacy__p">On application we may wish to follow links provided by you directly or indirectly to publicly available information that you have published on the internet – this may include sources such as Github and other social media profiles.<br></p>
      <h2 class="privacy__headline">Uses Made Of Your Information<br></h2>
      <h3 class="privacy__subline">Lawful basis for processing<br></h3>
      <p class="privacy__p">We rely on legitimate interest as the lawful basis on which we collect and use your personal data. Our legitimate interests are the recruitment of staff working at New Vector.<br></p>
      <h3 class="privacy__subline">Purposes of processing<br></h3>
      <p class="privacy__p">We use information held<br></p>
      <ul class="privacy__p">
        <li class="privacy__p">To consider your application in respect of a role for which you have applied.<br></li>
        <li class="privacy__p">To consider your application in respect of other roles.<br></li>
        <li class="privacy__p">To communicate with you in respect of the recruitment process.<br></li>

      </ul>
      <h2 class="privacy__headline">How we store your personal data<br></h2>
      <h3 class="privacy__subline">Security<br></h3>
      <p class="privacy__p">We take appropriate measures to ensure that all personal data is kept secure including security measures to prevent personal data from being accidentally lost, or used or accessed in an unauthorised way. We limit access to your personal data to those who have a genuine business need to know it. Those processing your information will do so only in an authorised manner and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.<br></p>
      <p class="privacy__p">We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach where we  are legally required to do so.<br></p>
      <p class="privacy__p">Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted through any online means, therefore any transmission remains at your own risk.<br></p>
      <h3 class="privacy__subline">Where we store your personal data<br></h3>
      <p class="privacy__p">Where we store your personal data in our own systems, it is stored within the European Economic Area (EEA).<br></p>
      <p class="privacy__p">As is common practice, we may use a third party Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to manage the recruitment process. The ATS will either store relevant data within the EEA or have signed a Data Processor Agreement to safeguard your privacy rights and give you remedies in the unlikely event of a misuse of your personal data.<br></p>
      <h3 class="privacy__subline">How long we keep your personal data<br></h3>
      <p class="privacy__p">We will hold your personal data for up to a year after application unless you request that we remove before the year is out (See “Your Rights”).<br></p>
