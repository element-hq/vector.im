Why choose Vector?


Powered by Matrix   [was 'Everything together']

Vector is built on Matrix: a new open ecosystem for interoperable communication.  From Github to Jira, from IRC to Slack: access the ever-growing range of networks, bots and integrations available through Matrix.  Easily connect to your contacts: they don't even need to create an account!

From Github to Jira, from IRC to Slack: Vector uses the new open Matrix ecosystem to access a galaxy of networks, bots and integrations.  Talking to your contacts has never been easier: they don't even need to create an account!


Open Source Freedom.

Vector is entirely open source software: all the code is published on <a href="https://github.com/vector-im">GitHub</a> (Apache License) for anyone to see and extend.  And thanks to Matrix, it's trivial to add new integrations via the open <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec">Matrix Spec</a>.


Own your data.

We believe nobody should control your communication but you.  Run your own Matrix server to host your own data; access it with whatever Matrix client you like.  <a href="https://matrix.org/jira/browse/SPEC-162">Soon</a>, protect your conversation with state of the art end-to-end encryption using Matrix's <a href="https://matrix.org/git/olm/about">Olm cryptographic ratchet</a>.  Only you have the key to your data.


Get the right balance

We all know how distracting messaging apps can be. Vector provides an unobtrusive interface with simple yet powerful control over your notifications, making it easy to tune in or tune out on your own terms.
